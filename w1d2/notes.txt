Incremental Development
  -using errors (error driven development)

1. define the problem
2. what are my inputs to the program?
3. what is the intended output at the end?
4. write code that will test the behavior
5. refactor the code that you wrote earlier to improve as you go
6. thinking about and writing a plan for handling edge cases (vs. just "happy path")

incremental approach

0. have a hypothesis of the error
1. create error
2. solve that error
hypothesis of change in behavior
run and confirm/deny hypothesis
3. see if you can improve that solution
4. repeat
